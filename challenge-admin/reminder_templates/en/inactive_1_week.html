        Hello Parent,
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as one needs to learn to be a safe driver before taking the wheel,
        children need <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ (digital intelligence)
        education before they can safely navigate the digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>
            We see that your child has not been active in the last 7 days,
            and are yet to complete the program.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Please actively encourage your child to complete the
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b> <b style="color:#4992f9;">World</b>™
        journey by logging into <a href="{{url_root}}">DQWorld.net</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ education tools
        and assessment have been tested and proven.
        Initial results indicate a <b>30% reduction in risky online behaviour</b>
        and an <b>increase in personal strengths</b> such as critical thinking,
        empathy and global citizenship.
    </p>

    <p>
        When your child completes the
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b> <b style="color:#4992f9;">World</b>™
        programme, you will have the opportunity to get a personalized
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ <b>Report</b> showing the
        strengths and weaknesses of your child’s digital intelligence,
        the extent of exposure to various online risks,
        and some practical recommendations to improve your
        child’s <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ based on their profile.
        Such information is invaluable for parents concerned
        with the progress and welfare of their child.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for joining the
        #<b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b><b style="color:#4992f9;">EveryChild</b>™ movement.
    </p>
