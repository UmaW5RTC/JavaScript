        Hello Parent,
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
        Your child has been developing their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™
        (digital intelligence quotient) on the
        skill of Critical Thinking –

        <li>How to Avoid Violent Content</li>
        <li>What is Inappropriate Content?</li>
        <li>How to Content Critique</li>
        <li>True vs. False Info</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Just as one needs to learn to be a safe driver
        before taking the wheel, children need
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ education
        before they can safely navigate the digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Share this badge with your child, family and friends
        to recognise their skill development and their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ Digital Citizenship.
