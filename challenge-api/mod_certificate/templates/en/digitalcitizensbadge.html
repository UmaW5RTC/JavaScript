        Hello Parent,
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
        Your child has been developing their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™
        (digital intelligence quotient) on the
        skill of Digital Citizen Identity –
        an ability to build and manage a healthy
        congruent identity online and offline with integrity.
        They have learnt:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top:0">
        <li>How does the internet work?</li>
        <li>Digital Leader creed</li>
        <li>Being a Global Citizen</li>
        <li>What’s my dream?</li>
        <li>Congruent online and offline identities</li>
        <li>Integrity of Online Persona</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Just as one needs to learn to be a safe driver
        before taking the wheel, children need
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ education
        before they can safely navigate the digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Share this badge with your child, family and friends
        to recognise their skill development and their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ Digital Citizenship.
    </p>
