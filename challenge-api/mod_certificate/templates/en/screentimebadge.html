        Hello Parent,
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
        Your child has been developing their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™
        (digital intelligence quotient) on the
        skill of Screen Time Management –
        an ability to manage one’s screen time,
        multitasking, and one’s engagement in
        online games and social media with self-control.
        They have learnt:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-top:0">
        <li>Controlling Multi-tasking</li>
        <li>Preventing Game Addiction</li>
        <li>Harmful Effects of Excessive Screen Time</li>
        <li>Self-Control in Digital Use</li>
        <li>Balancing Screen Time</li>
        <li>Family Media Rule</li>
        <li>Managing Time and Priorities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Just as one needs to learn to be a safe driver
        before taking the wheel, children need
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ education
        before they can safely navigate the digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Share this badge with your child, family and friends
        to recognise their skill development and their
        <b style="color:#f9631c;">DQ</b>™ Digital Citizenship.
